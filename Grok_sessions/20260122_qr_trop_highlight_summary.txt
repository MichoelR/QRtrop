# Session Summary: QR Project Trop Mismatch Highlighting Enhancement
Date: January 24, 2026

## Overview
This session enhanced the QR project's mismatch display output to include larger and bolded styling for the trop element that marks the mismatch, matching the existing treatment of the syntax element. The change ensures visual consistency in highlighting mismatched branches between trop and syntax trees.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Code Modification**: Updated `NewCode/mkrqr7_current.int` in the row3 trop display loop (line 151) to conditionally add the `mismatch-pair` CSS class to the trop word's span when `i = wrd1` (the end word of the mismatch trop branch).
- **Styling Reuse**: Leveraged the existing `.mismatch-pair` CSS rule in `out/includes/style.css` (font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;) for the trop highlight, eliminating the need for new CSS.
- **Consistency**: Now both trop and syntax mismatch elements are visually emphasized in the same way, improving user identification of mismatches.

## Implementation Details
- Original line: `  . S row3 = "<td>"_tropL_"<span class='verse-trop'>"_$zstrip(trop,"<W")_"</span>"_tropR_"</td>" _ row3`
- Modified to: `  . S tropClass="verse-trop"_$S(i=wrd1:" mismatch-pair",1:""), row3 = "<td>"_tropL_"<span class='"_tropClass_"'>"_$zstrip(trop,"<W")_"</span>"_tropR_"</td>" _ row3`
- This dynamically sets the class to include `mismatch-pair` only for the mismatch trop word.

## Status
- Change applied and tested successfully.
- Output now highlights the mismatch trop element with larger, bolded font, aligning with syntax highlighting.
- Project ready for further enhancements if needed.
