# Session Summary: QR Project Final Enhancements and Completion
Date: January 23, 2026

## Overview
This session finalized the QR project's ^torah2 database enhancements with BHSA BigTables for deeper Biblical Hebrew syntax nesting. Key issues were resolved, formats updated, and the output corrected for accurate loading into the MUMPS cache. The result enables unlimited syntax tree depth, with mother and functional_parent fields properly distinguished.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Output Format Update**: Changed from comma-separated fields to tab-separated fields, with comma-delimited values within fields. Verse IDs now use comma-separated book,chapter,verse.
- **Data Corrections**:
  - Switched to functional_parent for hierarchical links (enabling unlimited nesting).
  - Corrected mother field to use actual BHSA mother values (not functional_parent).
  - Ensured mother, rela, typ fields match syntax node counts (not all rows).
- **File Location**: Output saved to ../grammar_v_trop-v3.0.txt to avoid git inclusion.
- **MUMPS Loader Update**: Modified mkrqr6_current.int to handle tab-separated fields.
- **Validation**: Verified field lengths match (e.g., 17 elements per syntax field for Genesis 1:1).

## Final Status
- Script generates correct v3.0 output with proper mother vs. functional_parent distinction.
- Loaded into cache, confirming >4 levels of nesting.
- Project ready for advanced syntax analysis.

## Notes
- Mother field provides syntactic dependencies; functional_parent enables deeper hierarchies.
- All changes maintain backward compatibility where possible.
