Topic: Mismatch Highlighting Fixes for Torah Verse Output

Overview:
In this session, we focused on resolving issues related to mismatch highlighting in the comprehensive verse output generated by `mkrqr8.int`. The goal was to ensure that orange and blue boxes correctly highlight trop and syntax mismatches in verses, including handling single and multiple mismatches with radio button selections.

Key Issues Addressed:
1. Fixed UNDEF error in `displayVerse` function by initializing mismatch variables.
2. Replaced dropdown with radio buttons for mismatch selection, ensuring all mismatches are visible.
3. Added functionality to display highlighting boxes for mismatches, updating dynamically with radio button selection.
4. Moved JavaScript and CSS for highlighting to separate files (`verseDisplay.js` and `highlight.css`) for better organization.
5. Corrected DOM traversal in `mismatch.js` to locate mismatch data within `mismatch-selector` div.
6. Ensured highlighting works for single mismatch cases without radio buttons.
7. Removed debugging logs from JavaScript files after successful implementation.

Files Modified:
- `NewCode/mkrqr8.int`: Updated to handle single mismatches, initialize variables, and include necessary scripts.
- `out/includes/verseDisplay.js`: Added logic for dynamic highlighting based on radio button selection.
- `out/includes/highlight.css`: Enhanced CSS for more prominent highlighting with `!important` overrides.
- `out/includes/mismatch.js`: Fixed DOM traversal and added support for single mismatch highlighting.

Outcome:
The mismatch highlighting now works correctly for both single and multiple mismatch cases. Radio button selections update the highlighted boxes dynamically, and the code has been cleaned up by removing debug logs.

Next Steps:
- Monitor for any additional issues with highlighting in different browser environments.
- Consider further optimizations or enhancements to the user interface for mismatch selection.

Thanks for the collaboration, and I'm happy to assist with any further refinements!
