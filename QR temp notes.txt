Wow - Chaim, take a look at rows 1452-1454 (equally, rows 1471-1473) in the input file bhsac.tsv (or head.tsv if you have it), Bereishis 1:22, 
וַיְבָ֧רֶךְ אֹתָ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵאמֹ֑ר פְּר֣וּ וּרְב֗וּ וּמִלְא֤וּ אֶת־הַמַּ֨יִם֙ בַּיַּמִּ֔ים וְהָע֖וֹף יִ֥רֶב בָּאָֽרֶץ

See row 22 in the latest file you sent me, grammar_v_trop-v2.5.txt.
The words בַּיַּמִּ֔ים and בָּאָֽרֶץ each have _three_ syntactic rows and corresponding pieces: 'prep', 'art', 'subs',
That is, preposition "in", article "the", and noun "sea" or "earth". But you only sent me two "pieces" each, like 'בָּ', 'אָֽרֶץ'. Two of the syntactical pieces are in the single word 'בָּ'.

In the input file row 1472 has an empty text piece [maybe you use g_lex_utf8 ?], just syntax, which is probably why you didn't send a "part" for it, just 'בָּ', 'אָֽרֶץ'. The result is that my code miscounts and includes the next part, expecting three. I don't see how that can be fixed on my end; there's no way for it to know; it just relies on the order. 
Could you correct it to send three "parts" instead of two, like 'בָּ', '', 'אָֽרֶץ' for each of them?

I think I'm going to at least need some error-checking on my side, counting appropriate pieces from each of the sections. I only found this by luck/siyata dishmaya.
